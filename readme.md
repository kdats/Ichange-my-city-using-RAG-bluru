# Bangalore Civic Complaint Analytics with RAG and Gemini LLM

## 1. Introduction

Bangalore, also known as Bengaluru, is a city with more than 10 million residents. Like many fast-growing urban centers, it faces daily challenges related to civic infrastructure: garbage disposal, broken roads, water supply issues, traffic congestion, streetlight failures, and more.
Citizens regularly experience these problems and, increasingly, expect ways to hold the government accountable.
iChangeMyCity is one of India's most significant civic technology platforms. It lets residents submit complaints about city problems directly to government authorities and tracks the status of those complaints.

However, as the number of complaints grows into the thousands or even hundreds of thousands, it becomes difficult for city officials, journalists, or concerned citizens to understand the real patterns in the data.
A dashboard may show only how many complaints were filed or how many remain unresolved, but cannot answer nuanced, real-world questions such as:

* Which neighborhoods have chronic garbage issues?
* What are the most common complaints in a particular ward this year?
* Are there seasonal trends in road damage or water supply problems?

To solve this, we implement a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system, which uses both advanced search and natural language understanding to answer complex questions about the city’s civic complaints—grounded directly in the real reports submitted by citizens.

This document explains every part of the system, the reasons for each technology choice, and how RAG can transform city analytics.

## 2. Project Objectives

* Build a robust RAG pipeline to enable natural language Q\&A over a large civic complaints dataset
* Allow users (officials, citizens, researchers) to ask nuanced questions and receive clear, evidence-based answers
* Demonstrate best practices in text chunking, semantic vector search, persistent vector storage, and LLM prompting
* Create a modular, extendable codebase suitable for other cities or datasets

---

## 3. About the Data

The data for this project comes from [iChangeMyCity.com](https://www.ichangemycity.com/), an open platform for reporting public grievances in Bangalore.
Each row in the dataset corresponds to a complaint filed by a citizen. The columns are:

* **category**: The main type of civic issue (for example, garbage, roads, water, streetlights, etc)
* **location**: The name of the locality or neighborhood where the issue occurred
* **ward\_name**: The name of the municipal ward (Bangalore is divided into about 200 wards)
* **complaint**: Free-text details of the problem, written by the complainant
* **status**: Whether the complaint is resolved, in progress, or pending
* **date**: The date the complaint was filed

This structure provides a rich set of information for semantic search, filtering, and analysis.

## 4. What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a system design that combines two key steps:

### 4.1 Retrieval

Rather than making the language model “guess” or invent answers from general world knowledge, RAG systems first **retrieve the most relevant documents or text passages** from a trusted local knowledge base.
This is often done using **vector search**, where both the user’s question and each document are mapped to a high-dimensional vector space. Documents most similar to the query are retrieved for use as context.

### 4.2 Augmentation and Generation

The retrieved context is then passed, along with the user’s question, to a Large Language Model (LLM) such as Gemini (from Google) or GPT (from OpenAI).
The LLM then generates an answer, **grounded in the provided context**, rather than just its own training data.
This makes answers more accurate, up-to-date, and evidence-based, and allows the model to reference data it was never directly trained on.

### 4.3 Why RAG Matters

Traditional LLMs often hallucinate, especially when answering questions about niche or up-to-date topics.
RAG allows us to build search and Q\&A systems that are:

* **Fact-based** (not just plausible-sounding)
* **Flexible** (can be adapted to any structured dataset)
* **Explainable** (can show the user the source passages behind each answer)

## 5. Key Concepts and Components

### 5.1 Chunking

Most civic complaint datasets contain text fields (like “complaint”) that may range from a few words to several paragraphs.
It is inefficient and often ineffective to treat an entire record or a whole document as a single searchable unit.
**Chunking** breaks up the data into smaller, semantically coherent pieces (chunks).
For example, if a complaint description is too long, chunking ensures that each query is compared to only the most relevant pieces of information.

**Why Chunking?**

* Improves retrieval quality
* Prevents the LLM from being overloaded with irrelevant context
* Ensures that answers are based on focused, topical information

The most common method is a sliding window (with overlap) or using tools like LangChain’s `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, which splits text at natural boundaries like paragraphs, sentences, or punctuation.

**Parameters you can control:**

* `chunk_size`: Maximum size of each chunk (e.g., 600 characters or tokens)
* `chunk_overlap`: Number of characters/tokens that are shared between consecutive chunks (helps keep context between chunks)

### 5.2 Vector Embeddings and Search

To make semantic search possible, both chunks and queries are embedded as vectors in a high-dimensional space using a pre-trained model, such as **Sentence Transformers MiniLM**.
When a user asks a question, their query is embedded as a vector, and the system retrieves the chunks with the closest vectors, i.e., those that are most semantically similar to the query.

This is much better than keyword search, as it captures meaning and not just exact words.

### 5.3 Persistent Vector Store

**What is a persistent vector store?**

A vector store is a database or system that stores vector representations of text chunks so they can be searched quickly at query time.
A **persistent** vector store saves its index and vectors to disk (or another storage), so you do not need to recompute embeddings every time the system restarts or loads new data.

In this project, we use **ChromaDB** as the persistent vector database.

* When you first load and process the data, you store all chunk vectors in Chroma.
* When you run the notebook again (and the data hasn’t changed), you can simply reload the index from disk, saving time and compute.

Persistent vector stores are essential for real-world systems that work with large, evolving datasets.

**Why is this important?**

* Saves computation time (embeddings are expensive to recompute)
* Ensures fast startup for large or production-grade systems
* Supports updates: you can add new chunks without starting over

### 5.4 LangChain

LangChain is a modular framework for building advanced LLM workflows.
In this project, it provides:

* Easy ways to load data from a DataFrame
* Text chunking with flexible splitters
* Metadata management for each chunk (such as area, ward, status, etc)
* Retrieval tools that interface with vector stores like Chroma
* Prompt templating and connection to LLMs (although for Gemini, you may use its native API directly)

### 5.5 Retrieval Parameters: fetch\_k and Top-k

Retrieval from a vector store is controlled by two parameters:

* `fetch_k`: The number of candidate chunks initially fetched based on vector similarity
* `k`: The final number of chunks used as context for the LLM

This two-step process ensures that even if the nearest chunks are very similar (e.g., all about the same topic), you have a larger pool to select from, which increases diversity and quality in the results.

Example: Fetch the 20 nearest neighbors, then select the best 6 as LLM context.

## 6. Detailed Workflow

### 6.1 Data Loading and Preprocessing

* Read the CSV file into a DataFrame
* Clean the text fields (fill NAs, strip whitespace, fix encodings)
* Combine relevant columns into a single string for embedding, such as:
  `"{category}. Location: {location}. Ward: {ward_name}. Details: {complaint}. Status: {status}. Date: {date}"`

### 6.2 Chunking

* Use a function or LangChain’s chunking tools to split each complaint into overlapping chunks
* Store any useful metadata with each chunk (for later filtering or grouping)

### 6.3 Embedding

* Use Sentence Transformers’ MiniLM (or another model) to convert all chunks to vectors
* Store these vectors in a persistent ChromaDB database

### 6.4 Retrieval

* When a user enters a query, embed the query text as a vector
* Retrieve the top-k relevant chunks from Chroma, possibly using a larger `fetch_k` to improve result diversity

### 6.5 LLM Augmentation and Answer Generation

* Combine the user’s question with the retrieved context in a prompt
* Pass this prompt to the Gemini LLM API
* Gemini generates a natural language answer, only using the provided context

### 6.6 Output and User Interface

* The answer is printed along with (optionally) the supporting chunks used for context
* Users can try new questions, change retrieval parameters, or adapt the code for dashboards or chatbots

---

## 7. Example Queries

* Which areas are most prone to garbage dumping issues?
* What are the top three infrastructure-related complaints in Indiranagar?
* Which wards have the most unresolved water supply problems in 2021?
* List all complaints from ward\_name “Shivajinagar” with status “pending.”

The system will retrieve only the most relevant complaint records, summarize or synthesize them, and produce a clear answer.

---

## 8. Security and Key Management

* The Gemini API key is read from a secure file (such as env.txt) or set as an environment variable.
* The code does not hardcode the API key, supporting safe usage in shared or public environments.
* For production use, always follow security best practices for key management.

---

## 9. Extensibility and Adaptability

This project is built to be easily extended:

* You can swap out the embedding model for a more advanced or domain-specific one.
* ChromaDB supports many storage options and can scale up for larger datasets.
* The code structure supports metadata filtering, so you can add features like “show only complaints from 2022” or “filter by status.”
* The prompt for Gemini can be easily modified for different types of outputs (summaries, lists, explanations).
* The core logic can be used for other domains (health, legal, scientific data, etc) where factual Q\&A over text records is needed.

---

## 10. Why Use This Approach (Compared to Traditional Dashboards)

* **Traditional dashboards** can display metrics and charts, but not answer complex “why” or “what” questions.
* **Keyword search** often misses meaning, synonyms, or related concepts.
* **RAG with chunking, persistent vector search, and LLM generation** makes your data truly interactive and explorable, with factual, up-to-date, and flexible answers.

## 14. FAQ

**Q: What is a persistent vector store?**
A persistent vector store (like ChromaDB) is a database that stores text embeddings and allows fast similarity search, even after your code restarts. This means you only need to embed your data once, and you can reuse the search index in future sessions, making large-scale or production RAG systems efficient and scalable.

**Q: Why not just use the whole dataset as context?**
Passing all records to the LLM is impossible for non-trivial datasets due to input length limits and inefficiency. Retrieval and chunking ensure the model only receives the most relevant, manageable context.

**Q: Can I use this for other data?**
Yes. Any dataset with unstructured or semi-structured text fields can be indexed, chunked, and searched using this approach.

**Q: What if my data is updated?**
You can add or update embeddings in the vector store incrementally. Persistent stores support additions, deletions, and reindexing.
