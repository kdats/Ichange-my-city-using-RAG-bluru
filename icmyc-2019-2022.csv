All Borewells in the layout, have gone dry and water tankers are charging exorbitant amounts to supply water. Last year the BWSSB issued notices and threatened, all residents and apartments, with blocking of sewage lines, if they did not apply and pay the charges to BWSSB for Kaveri water connection. Almost 60% owners and apartments have paid the demand charges of BWSSB. Others are waiting for BWSSB to put the Main Kaveri water line, into the layout, as they don't trust thr BWSSB, to keep their commitment. BWSSB, started the work and immediately stopped the laying of the main water line. When contacted, they are blaming the BBMP for not giving road cutting permission. This is all rubbish excuses. Even our local people representatives, are showing no concern for the hardship faced by the citizens. The situation, due to summer is now alarming. I urge our local leaders to kindly look into the matter and clear unnecessary bottlenecks, cause by people with vested interests.

I would like to draw your attention to the problems of garbage and litter in Doddanekkundi. This landmark is very dirty because there are a lot of uneducated people living, and they are making it very dirty. We have been complaining to the MLA ( Arvind Limbavali ) about this problem, but he is not doing anything. This area has been filthy since 2014, and I am surprised that there are no trucks and auto tippers for clearing garbage and litter. I feel sick living in my landmark. Please put more dustbins in this landmark, and please make sure that the whole landmark's cleaned without any debris. Please also do something to make these people educated about cleanliness.

Water flows out of a manhole on one end of the street only to flow into a canal at the other end of the street. The place where it flows into the canal is a deadly place with no Street lights, at least half a feet deep water and open flow into the canal. 

Just now i tried coming through it on my bike and i had to stop suddenly as a car stopped infront of me. I put my leg on the side for support only to find it was entrance to the canal and my whole leg slipped into the canal. Bike weight is over me and i couldn't get up. Luckily some people lifted the bike and saved me. 

This happens everytime there is a strong rain. Almost all the 5000 residents in this colony are employees who are paying lakhs of rupees in taxes every year. But even then there is no basic safety for all these residents.
